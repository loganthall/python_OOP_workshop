# python_OOP_workshop
One of my weekly workshop projects that was designed to help dive into OOP.

Find a usable demonstration of this code [here](https://replit.com/@loganthall/pythonOOPdemo#oop_demo.py)

In the workshop code, we were tasked with creating a basic "banking" application. 
It creates objects using the BankUser Class, which is a subclass of the User Class. 
The objects have attributes that are common attributes among all BankUsers, 
but have unique values to the object itself. Functions to deposit, withdraw, 
transfer, and request fund are created, and each function is dependant on 
authorization with the objects Name and PIN attributes.
